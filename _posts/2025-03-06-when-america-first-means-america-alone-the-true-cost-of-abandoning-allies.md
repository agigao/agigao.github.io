In the past twenty days, the world has witnessed a dramatic shift in American foreign policy that demands urgent examination. The administration's abrupt decision to halt military assistance, intelligence sharing, and other critical support to Ukraine raises profound questions about America's place in the world and the true meaning of "America First."

## The Betrayal of Trust
What does it mean when a superpower abandons its allies in their moment of greatest need? The recent celebration of this policy shift by some reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of how American power and prosperity were built. America's strength was never constructed in isolation but through a complex web of alliances, mutual trust, and shared values that define Western civilization.
History shows that betrayal between allies is not without precedent-or consequences.

## Lessons from History: The Price of Broken Promises
In 1783, King Erekle II of Kingdom of Kartli and Kakheti signed the Treaty of Georgievsk with Imperial Russia. This military alliance promised Russian protection against Persian and Ottoman invasions, a commitment made on the foundation of shared Orthodox Christian faith.
Yet when Georgia faced its moment of truth in 1795, as Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar led 30,000-40,000 Persian troops against the Georgian capital, Russia was nowhere to be found. Despite desperate pleas for help, Russian forces never arrived. The Battle of Krtsanisi raged for three days from September 8-11, resulting in catastrophic losses-4,000 of Georgia's 5,000 soldiers perished, while the Persians lost approximately 13,000 of their own forces. Afterward, Tbilisi was burned to the ground. Over 15,000 civilians were captured and forcibly relocated to Iran.

Why did Russia abandon its ally? The answer became clear six years later when Russia annexed the weakened Georgian kingdom in 1801, reducing it to a mere province of the Russian Empire.

This was not an isolated incident but rather a pattern that has defined Russian foreign policy for centuries-making promises of protection, failing to deliver when needed, then exploiting the resulting vulnerability for territorial gain.

## America's Choice: Leader or Betrayer?
Today, we stand at a crossroads. By halting support to Ukraine, the United States risks being painted with the same colors as Russia-a nation infamous for violating alliances and agreements. Is this truly putting "America First," or does it serve some other purpose? Recent reports suggest that behind this policy shift lies a troubling agenda: leveraging Ukraine's desperate situation to force concessions on valuable mineral rights to American interests while simultaneously pressuring territorial capitulations to Russia. These actions resemble not partnership but exploitation of an ally's vulnerability during wartime. The true motivations behind this policy shift raise serious questions about who actually benefits from America's retreat from its security commitments while simultaneously pursuing economic advantages.
When allies who have built their defense strategies around American promises are abandoned, it sends a clear message to every nation that has placed its trust in America: commitments are conditional, temporary, and subject to domestic political winds.

## The Hidden Costs of Abandonment
An important question begs to be asked: Can't the United States, as a superpower, thrive alone? Does America truly need allies in today's world?
The answer lies in understanding how American power actually works. Economic strength depends on global trade networks, military effectiveness relies on forward bases and intelligence sharing, and diplomatic influence stems from being the leader of a coalition rather than a solitary actor. Even with unmatched military might, no nation can simultaneously secure all its interests worldwide without partners who share burdens and multiply capabilities.
China and Russia understand this reality well-which is why they work tirelessly to isolate the United States from its allies. They recognize what some seem to have forgotten: true superpowers don't stand alone; they stand at the center of systems of allied nations.

Consider these crucial questions:
1. What do Americans truly gain from abandoning Ukraine while simultaneously seeking to acquire its mineral resources?
2. Who benefits from the erosion of American credibility?
3. What happens to leverage in future negotiations when potential partners know commitments might be withdrawn?
4. How will this affect Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, and NATO allies who depend on American security guarantees?

The rhetoric of "America First" promises strength through isolation, but history teaches us that nations which betray allies often find themselves without friends when they most need them.

## Beyond Ukraine: The True Meaning of Leadership Versus Exploitation
The Western alliance system that has preserved peace and prosperity for decades was not built on transactions but on trust. When that trust is abandoned for short-term political expediency, a nation doesn't strengthen itself-it weakens itself fundamentally.

True leadership means understanding that prosperity and security are intertwined with a global system of mutual support and shared values. Undermining that system doesn't put America first; it puts America alone.

These policy shifts deserve careful examination by citizens everywhere-do they truly serve long-term national interests or do they represent a historical mistake that future generations will study alongside other great betrayals of alliances? The answer will define not only Ukraine's fate but America's place in the world for decades to come.

## A Voice from Beyond
### What (even) Henry Kissinger Might Have Said:
> **The False Economy of Abandoned (Real) Alliances**: â€œThe abrupt withdrawal of support from Ukraine represents a profound strategic miscalculation. By pursuing immediate economic advantages and territorial settlements while abandoning a security commitment, the United States risks not only its credibility but the very architecture of international order it spent decades constructing. Great powers maintain their influence not through transactional extractions but through consistent application of power aligned with long-term interests. This administration appears to confuse tactical opportunism with strategic vision. Russia seeks not partnership but dominance through Ukraine's dismemberment, and China observes with satisfaction as America voluntarily cedes its position as guarantor of international stability. I've always maintained that foreign policy requires balancing ideals with interests, but abandoning allies while seeking their resources achieves neither. History rarely rewards those who mistake retreat for realism."
